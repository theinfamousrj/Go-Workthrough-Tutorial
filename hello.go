//Go likes to work in packages
package main

//This imports fmt which contains the Println() function
import "fmt"

//Typical main function
func main() {

  //This is the line that actually prints the message
  fmt.Println("Hello world!")

}

//when you are done save this file and type 'go run hello.go'
